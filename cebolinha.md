Cebolinha (in its teenage version, Cebola) is a character in comic books and strips, created in 1960 by Mauricio de Sousa. Always looking for a way to catch his friend Monica's bunny, Samsão.

In addition to participating in the stories with his group of friends, Cebolinha also participates in the Crazy's stories, characterized by completely absurd situations that do not occur in the stories with the group. Cebolinha also participates in stories with Xaveco, a secondary character from Turma da Mônica.

Biography
Although Cebolinha is today considered part of Turma da Mônica, he was created before Mônica (who appeared in 1963). Cebolinha got its own comic book in 1973, launched three years after the first edition of the magazine "Mônica".

Cebolinha was based on one of his brother's childhood friends, Marcio de Sousa, when Maurício lived in Mogi das Cruzes, and his father, Antonio de Sousa, would have nicknamed his children's friend "Cebolinha" because of his hair. skewered. The person Mauricio was inspired by is Luiz Carlos da Cruz, a former house painter who currently lives in Mogi das Cruzes. The nickname was given by Mauricio's father when the owner of a bar opposite Antonio's barbershop drew eyes and a mouth on an onion and kicked it into the street. Antonio looked at the onion and said it was just like Luiz, he was Cebolinha.

The character's trademark is his dyslalia, changing the letters R to L in his pronunciation (for example, with the tongue twister “O lato loeu a loupa do lei de Loma”; the words “eladas” are usually indicated with quotation marks or bold -italics), which causes great inconvenience. For example, in the film An Adventure in Time, in the scene in which the Astronaut faints, the villain Black Hair threatens to turn him into a rat through a device that could only be deactivated with the words "Black Hair" being pronounced correctly. However, because of Cebolinha's dyslalia, he is unable to do so – being saved at the last second by his friend Cascão.

Unlike his best friend Cascão, who has never taken a bath, he is the one who comes into contact with water the most.

One of the most beloved and important characters in the history of Brazilian comics, Cebolinha also became known in many other countries. In Spanish, it is called Cebollita (also changing R to L); in English, his name is Jimmy Five (he changes the pronunciation of the letters R to W).

History
Famous for the popular strips by Mauricio de Sousa, Cebolinha appeared for the first time in October 1960, as a secondary character in the daily black and white strips of "Bidu e Franjinha", published in the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, but gained prominence and soon became the protagonist.

The character was based on Luiz Carlos da Cruz, a friend of Márcio (Mauricio's brother) and resident of the city of Mogi das Cruzes. He also changed the "R" to the "L" and had spiky hair, being nicknamed by Márcio's father as "Cebolinha".

In the stories, Cebolinha is about eight years old and lives in the São Paulo neighborhood of Limoeiro. These first strips until then were basically circulated in São Paulo. But when they got their revised version, they became known in other states. And Cebolinha himself grew in popularity, displacing the “title holders” Bidu and Franjinha. Our letter changer then became the main figure in the newspaper strips. And soon he gained his own supporting actors. Floquinho, his strange green “Lhasa Apso” dog, was one of them. And, in the strip on March 21, 1963, opposite Cebolinha, the girl Mônica and her stuffed rabbit appeared. And that ugly, short and buck-toothed little girl would end up, in turn, displacing Cebolinha himself, becoming the flagship of the “Mauriciano” universe.

Comic book publishing

The first edition of Cebolinha's own title, published in 1973 by Editora Abril.
Cebolinha debuted in a strip for the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper in October 1960, and was published by Editora Continental in the Bidu magazine. It would then appear in the magazine Zaz Traz, published by Continental, and also on the cover of the magazine's almanac - all at the same time.

The character would gain his own title in January 1973 by Editora Abril and later by publishers Editora Globo and Panini in a format.

In addition to the monthly title, Cebolinha has almanacs of republications.

In 2010, Cebolinha turned 50, to celebrate Panini released a luxury album in large format (19 x 27.5 cm) similar to the one made in honor of Bidu's 50th anniversary containing a selection of the character's stories and a story in style manga and cover is inspired by Cebolinha #1 from Editora Abril, the difference is that in Cebolinha's album there was no facsimile of the first magazine, as Panini had already published it in Coleção História vol 1 in September 2007, it was also released an edition of Cebola Jovem with 96 pages, all in color and large format (19 x 27.5 cm).

Characteristics
He speaks by changing the intervocalic R to L, a problem known as dyslalia;
It only has 5 strands of hair. It is interesting to note that, when created, Cebolinha had more spiky hair;
He is always devising "infallible" plans to defeat Mônica, called "owner of the street", or in his own words, "owner of the moon";
He always wears a green shirt, black shorts and brown shoes, being the only one of the four main characters to wear shoes, as Mônica, Cascão and Magali usually don't wear them.
He is the only one of the main characters who is not an only child, as he has a younger sister, Maria Cebolinha, inspired by Mariângela, daughter of Mauricio de Sousa. Because Maria Cebolinha does not have much importance in the stories (also because she is much younger than Cebolinha, being a baby in the children's stories), in the first stories he had another younger brother called Salsinha, but Maurício was unable to fit him into the chronology and left him aside.
He tends to be very arrogant and selfish, even with his friends. But deep down he likes them.
He thinks he has greater intellectual superiority than all his friends (including Franjinha), so much so that he sometimes uses Buddhist meditation techniques, wires for positive energy locations and even bamboo pyramids to improve the tune of his inspiration, but many He sometimes uses this characteristic to come up with infallible plans;
If he is easily stressed by people who disagree with him or upset him;
He is president of a boys' club, which brings together neighborhood kids to discuss games and plans against Mônica;
According to the comic book, his birthday is on October 24th and his zodiac sign is Scorpio;
Although Cebolinha shows himself to be São Paulo in the first stories, he is a fan of Palmeiras, as shown in the most recent comics. This happened because he wore a green shirt, associating him more with the alviverde than the tricolor.
Previously, Cebolinha said diacho. Currently he says pindarolas written incorrectly with the L in place of the R. Cebolinha still says diacho in some stories.
In newspaper comic strips from the 60s, he even gained a younger brother, with his name chosen by readers as Salsinha. However, the character disappeared shortly afterwards.

Monica's Young Gang
In Turma da Mônica Jovem, the boy prefers to be called simply Cebola and remains a smart and very intelligent boy. In addition to having become fuller, he now has a beautiful head of hair, but maintains the shape that reminds him of the five strands of hair from childhood. Often nicknamed "bald" by his best friend Cascão, Cebola fears that one day he will return to just five hairs, like his father and grandfather, and thus definitively manifest his paternal genetics. He no longer makes "infallible plans" to defeat Mônica and become the owner of the street, now he wants to conquer the world with his projects for a better world. He no longer changes 'erres' to 'they' because he underwent speech therapy for his dyslalia, but when he gets nervous, he still ends up changing letters. He has a crush on Xabéu, his old nanny, but the girl he really likes is Mônica, the target of his attention and teasing since childhood. He hid his love for her in childhood as a form of competition, but as a teenager, he no longer hides this feeling, especially in issue nº 04, when Mônica kisses him. During this first series, they have a very emphasized "colorful friendship" and start dating in issue 34, but break up at the end of the issue. In issue nº 50 (edition that takes place in the future) Cebola and Mônica get married. In April 2014, Mônica started dating Do Contra (“DC”) and since then, Cebola was fighting to win back his beloved Mônica. He returned with Mônica in issue 100, in December 2016, and since then, Mônica and Cebola have been together.

Floquinho: Cebolinha's pet dog. He is an excessively hairy and green Lhasa Apso, resembling a bush. Mauricio revealed that his visual inspiration was a mop. As he does not have a visible face, recurring jokes include knowing which side is the head and which is the tail. His fur is also so thick that many objects get lost inside, and sometimes Cebolinha and others use Floquinho as a hiding place.

Floquinho compared to a real Lhasa apso dog.
Crazy
See main article: Crazy (Mauricio de Sousa)
Licurgo Orival Umbelino Cafiaspirino de Oliveira, the Crazy (note the anagram joining the first letter of each of his names), is an obviously crazy character. It is said that he lives in a mental institution close to Cebolinha's house. That's why he keeps harassing the poor guy. He is always causing absurd and crazy situations, but without any bad intentions.

According to Maurício, "The Crazy has a lot of the craziness of the 1970s", being designed by his brother Márcio Sousa, and the look inspired by the designer Sidney Salustre. The Fool's stories always have a nonsense element, with the character misunderstanding expressions and words, and a certain use of metalanguage. From the 90s onwards, it is said that he escaped from the asylum and started living in his own house, a house filled with crazy and unimaginable decoration, where paintings and decorations take on a life of their own. A version of this house existed in the first Parque da Mônica version.

He always calls Cebolinha Carrot, although Cebolinha is already the name of a vegetable. He always jokes about calling it Carrot, as if saying that it will sprout if it falls hard on the ground and is watered. But Cebolinha keeps fighting. In Turma da Mônica Jovem, he starts calling Cebolinha de Cenoura (as seen in issue 33).
